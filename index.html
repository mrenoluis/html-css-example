       	<h1>CSS3 allows us to do all sorts of cool things!</h1>
          <p><strong>Multiple background images</strong> is a cool feature of CSS3. I used the background shorthand property to declare the position and repeating of the image to keep them all grouped together. What isn't obvious while looking at the syntax is which image is on top in the vertical stacking order when those images overlap.  The first is on top and they go down from there.</p>
          <p>To create a simple series of solid-color borders I used the <strong>box-shadow property</strong>. I used this property to make multiple drop shadows and inset shadows. Unlike the border property, box-shadow permits multiple shadows separated with a comma. The last shadow defined sits at the bottom of the stack.</p>
